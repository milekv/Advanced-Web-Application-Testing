# Performance Test Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Load Testing
1. Use JMeter to simulate 1000 concurrent users.
2. Open the application.
3. Perform actions such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
4. Monitor the response time and system performance.

## Scenario 2: Stress Testing
1. Use JMeter to gradually increase the number of users until the system breaks.
2. Identify the maximum user load the system can handle.
3. Monitor system behavior and identify bottlenecks.
